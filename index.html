            <h2>About the Event</h2>

            <p>This year’s free and family-friendly Norwalk’s Earth Day Festival (NEDF) will be bigger and
                better than ever! There will be activities and entertainment for all ages, including live music by
                the CUkes and guitarist Ian Biggs, a dance performance by the Norwalk Metropolitan Youth
                Ballet, Food Trucks, a ‘Picnic Grove’ with cozy blankets and seating, Guest Speakers, Tree
                Plantings on the Green, Yoga, Bike Repair Station, Sound Healing, and other various healing
                arts along with a wide variety of exhibitors including students from across our Norwalk Public
                schools—and there’s so much for kids to enjoy too, including Touch-A-Truck and Giant Jenga on
                the Green!</p>

            <p><b>Our theme is finding balance and harmony in each of the five elements: Earth, Air, Water,
                    Fire/Energy, and Spirit.</b> Throughout the day, exhibitors and scheduled speakers will highlight
                the small steps we can take that make big impacts in healing the Earth and ourselves (and save
                us money in the process, too)!</p>

            <p>Norwalk’s Earth Day Festival is a community-led event drawing support across Norwalk’s
                leading environmental groups, civic organizations, municipal agencies, local schools, legislative
                leaders, and our Mayor.  Festival-goers will enjoy learning more about the steps Norwalk is
                taking to protect the environment and our green spaces by increasing walkability,
                improving sidewalks, adding bike parking, expanding public transportation, providing clean air
                protection, water safety, and sustainability, and promoting beautification (tree plantings).</p>

            <p>To encourage residents to <b>“Get to The Green, Without a Machine”</b> organized walks and bike
                rides will originate from different points in the City in the morning and end at The
                Green at noon. Keep Norwalk Beautiful has a planned clean-up as well… More details to
                come!</p>
